# Implementing Gradient Descent

This is a collection of my Jupyter notebooks for Lesson 2: Implementing
Gradient Descent of Udacity's nanodegree program.

## Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries
installed:

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a pre-packaged Python
distribution that contains all the necessary libraries and software for this
project.

## Code

Jupyter notebooks have been created for lesson concepts that have supporting
code snippets. These Jupyter notebooks along with supporting data files and/or
supporting scripts have been separated into directories.

This repository contains the following directories:

- backpropagation
- graduate_admissions
- implenting_backpropagation
- mean_squared_error
- multilayer_perceptrons

## Run

To run the examples, open up an `Anaconda Prompt`, which is a terminal window
with the appropriate paths to the Anaconda installation. These examples
were developed with JupyterLab 1.2.6. In the terminal window, navigate
to the appropriate directory and open the appropriate notebook. For
backpropagation, we would do the following:

```
cd backpropagation
jupyter notebook backpropagation.ipynb
```
